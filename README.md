# OCR Tests

This repository contains some really basic scripts to perform OCR on a magazine scan.

1. `ocr.py` attempts to find strcutured data in the format of `Key: Value`
2. `ocr_basic.py` simply extacts all the text of the image. Important to make note it does not preserve proper structure when working with columns of text.

## Dependencies

All the requirements are listed on the `requirements.txt` file.
